# Graphs

In this project we implemented algorithms for developing a data structure into a deliberate weighted graph.
The graph contains a vertex number and the weight of the edge between 2 vertices.
The graph is directed - so you can only go in the direction of the green dot.
The graph is related, which means that every vertex has a edge that goes into it.

In this project we have a  4 package:

• algorithms:
      We implemented the graph_algorihms interface in Graph_Algo:
     
     Read and save files.
     
     Checking whether the graph is related.
     
     The shortest distance, the function receives 2 vertices and calculates the shortest distance between them.
     
     Copy - Deep copy of the graph.
     
     TSP - Calculates the route through all vertices in the graph.
      
 • DataStructure:
    We implemented the vertex and edge by the data structure – the HashMap.
    We implemented the graph interface in Dgraph:
    
    There are functions to add and remove vertex and edge,  get and set to vertex, edge and weight.
    
    Connect an edge with weight w between node src to node dest.
    
    MC - Counts the number of actions done on the graph.

 • utils:
 
 Tools to use and create the GUI (Point3D, Range, stdDraw).
 
 • Junit:
